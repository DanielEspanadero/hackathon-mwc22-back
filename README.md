## Notes on the realization of the project üìù

_At first I had the idea that instead of commands, the application would be an interaction with the user (Using arrows and numbers), without realizing that this would not be a CLI but rather a GUI, so I changed the idea of how it was going to be done in order to manage it through commands. Another thing that I ruled out that I also had in mind at the beginning is to use an express server, although for what the exercise asks for it is not necessary. Even so, the structure of the project is prepared so that creating a server in express and later making a connection with the front end is a matter of little time._
